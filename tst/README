This directory contains a test suite that tests most parts of the package.

These tests are run automatically by Travis, but can be run locally by
navigating to the root `pypersist` directory (the parent of this directory) and
calling

    python -m pytest

To get a report of code coverage, you can instead call

    python -m pytest --cov=pypersist

In addition to the requirements for installing the package, these tests require
MongoDB, Eve, pytest, and pytest-cov to be installed.  You can install these
using

    sudo apt install mongodb
    pip install --user eve pytest pytest-cov
